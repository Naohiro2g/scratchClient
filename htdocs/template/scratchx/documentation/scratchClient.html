        <h2>ScratchClient bridge to scratch2, scratchX</h2>
        <p>
        This documentation is applicable to connect the web version of scratch2 named scratchX from http://scratchx.org/#scratch with scratchClient.
        </p>
        <p>
        Connecting scratch2 to hardware needs the following steps
        </p>
        <p>
        Start scratchClient with the configuration xml file for your hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
        Load http://scratchx.org/#scratch into the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 'more blocks', 'Load Experimental Extension',
        </p>
        
        <img src="/images/scratchx/documentation/step_10.png"/>
        <p>
        press on Load Experimental Extensions and open Extension URL<br/>
               
 
        </p><img src="/images/scratchx/documentation/step_20.png"/>
        <p>
        Paste the following url into the form  https://megjlow.github.io/extensionloader.js
        </p>
        <p>
        This url brings the Load Extension Block into the additional block palette.
        </p>
        
        <img src="/images/scratchx/documentation/step_30.png"/>
        
        <p>
        The Load Extension Block is now used to load the scratchClient configuration. Best practice is to prepare a small script in stage which loads the scratchClient config.
         </p>
         <img src="/images/scratchx/documentation/step_40.png"/>
         <p>The program shall use 'blueFlag' in all places where the green flag hat <img src="/images/scratchx/documentation/step_50.png"/> is usually used.
         
         </p>
         <p>The url to use to load the scratchClient extension is http://localhost:8080/scratchx/js/extension.js<br/>
         If scratchClient is running on a different computer, change 'localhost' to either the other computer's IP-address which is something like 192.168.2.203 or perhaps a more meaningful name when the network configuration allows this.
         </p>
         <p>Validation. See the 'green' dots to the right of the extension name. If these turn red, connection is list and scratchClient is not started.
         </p>

      <h2>Loading a project using scratchClient extension</h2>
        <p>
             A program loaded from file system shows the Load Extension Block, but not the scratchClient extension. The blocks from the scratchClient extension are displayed as red blocks.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/scratchx/documentation/step_reload.png"/>  
        <p>
            When program is started with green flag and the proposed initial script is executed, the Load Extension Block
            reads the extension from scratchClient and the program can be used.
